# Hi, I'm Miguel Blanco ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I am a biomedical engineer, specializing in neuroengineering and data science. I have experience in designing and developing biomedical devices and artificial intelligence models for various applications in neuroscience and medicine. My most recent project, a brain-computer interface for real-time emotion classification, is a fundamental piece of the **NeuroHumanities Laboratory at Tecnologico de Monterrey**. I am always eager to learn new skills and explore new challenges in this exciting and rapidly evolving field. Currently, I am working as a data analyst at **Christus Center for Excellence and Innovation**, where I apply my data science skills to support various healthcare projects and initiatives.
